I don't know if anyone can say they understand software programming. Someone can understand a language like Javascript and Ruby. The issue is is they are only languages so they don't give a full picture of what there is. We add frameworks on top of languages so we can have macros which do a lot of work for us. I don't know anyone who'll need to understand the framework who doesn't work for the framework itself. 

However, there's more. It is not only frameworks, but github and dependencies we can download. It all becomes larger than one persons to comprehend completely. It is why we need to work efficently. I have gotten to point on my software programming journey where programming has become enjoyable. Those highs come with greater lows. If you feel you understand it when a road block comes up you will feel like you're an imposter. Things don't need to be so extreme. People in my cohort have come so far, and I have learned with them. Software Engineering includes things like the community which has been built to support other people. There will be a time when we don't understand the problem. When it happens you need to go to the source like reactjs or Mozilla MDN. A lot becomes lost in the jargon, but hopefully we find the template that will be most helpful. Something where it doesn't need to work but at least change the result. As long as there is momentum and change, the knowledge grows, as I try and fail. I can rely on the community of Software Engineering to keep me above water.
