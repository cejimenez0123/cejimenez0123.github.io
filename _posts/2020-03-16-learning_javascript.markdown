Learning Javascript I felt was the most culimitative of what I have learned so far. From the beginning where we would use object orientation to create relationships. To the point where we are now where we are creating manipulatabled DOM elements. 

There are things in the future, I didn't do well from that start but that I didn't do bad. Simply mistakes that build knowledge of how I will move in the future. I was trying to be more organized with my coding this time as well. I created a diagram to map the relationships for Trip,Location, and Ship. I wasn't sure I would need a User model. I could stick it somewhere with the trip. This became untenable, as I was putting to much information in the trip. I wasn't learning from what has already been done. There were already so many trip booking applications. I didn't think I would need to. I thought I knew. I could have saved myself time by being a mimic. 

A lot of code feels like mimicing until it isn't. The way I learn is by seeing and then doing. It is the reason why resource like W3schools is a great resource for me. W3schools has emulators where you can a little bit of what you can in an editor but not all. It does do enough from where you can tinker and reverse engineer a solution for the problems I had at the time. I don't know why I didn't praise it earleir. It puts me in the write the direction along with MDN, both great resources.

I had problems sometimes reading the javascript errors. They are short and indescriptive compared to ruby errors. However, once I became familliar things became more intuitive. I think this is how it will be in coding for me. Repetition until it becomes something that comes off the mind when I need it. I'm hoping for things like structuring code and directing the app how where I want it to go. If I misspell something, or put wrong information, where my most common error, they are annoying, however javascript debugger helps a lot. I used debuggers in almost every step in my code. To slow walk the process, seeing how things can be made simpler. I would make more readable if I could. The important part is that I understand what is happening in the code. I do understand what's happening in my code.

The thing I know about Javascript is there is so much more to learn. I hoping to learn more of events, and animtions, so I can make dynamic web pages that can be used. There is a wide diversity on the world wide web. I want to be capable. The way I will be capable is by slowing down the process of creation and not getting ahead of myself. I think I know how the final product is going to be. It is hubris. I will do more mapping, more research into my projects. To save time I could've used for more learning.
