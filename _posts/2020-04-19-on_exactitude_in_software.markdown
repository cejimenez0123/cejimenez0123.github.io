In quarantine I've been seeing a lot of good movies from A24. I have always been a film nerd. There are a lot of witticism in film. The one I'm think of now is "the set is a church, and the director is god." It is something to applies to a lot of fiend where people exert a lot of control. An author on a smaller scale is called the god of the word she creates in her book. 

Making my React app, I'm am not god. I can't exert total control like I am a writer. I am working along side React, Javascript, HTML, and Ruby to make something. It can likened to a teacher with a student. You tell the student what you want them to do. The student sometimes get's it wrong. It is ok, it is not a time to get mad at the student. The problem is, me as Engineer and Teacher and my development envirment as student, I am not clear enough in my instruction I want to grab a specific element not the first. Something goes wrong. There's a bug in the code. Everything goes awry. When this happen it is not to become frustrated but to realize the potential of computer not only as student, but also as creation. Like in my first paragraph we are the creator, we may not be god, but we are creator. The problem is you can't store all your code inside your head. I'm not a computer. I have a computer do it.

This is when we are not only creator, but also mapmaker. A map of the browser we created, but can no longer go back and start over. It is not a blank piece of paper. Too much is already in the code to remove one thing is too create more problem. It requires us to be precise. We need use the guide of errors unclear as they can be at times. Google is my friend. Google error.Read what the cause is. Return to code. Chart and go through the steps of the code. Dev Tools allow us to slow down the code. We can then see how information travels in between files. There are imports and props that must be made. I should've counted the times I went on a journey, when I could've looked if the prop was passed. I have the prop either in mapDispatchToProps, MapDispatchToState provided by redux, or I'm passing it down by hand. I always knew where to go to find the source of the problem. In React things come in smaller packages. It wasn't a Borgian map. The problems were often singular. I don't need to start over. I can simply keep walking on the map I've laid for myself direction markers created by me to guide. Using imports and props things became managable.
